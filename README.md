## About the Project
<<<<<<< HEAD

> This project was built for the World of Warcraft gaming community (specifically Classic-WoW), the goal was to make a clean & simple packaged UI which allowed players to calculate their weekly outcome(s) via the users given data. These caluclations where previously done via Google Spreadsheets which where very tedious so I felt being able to access this data quickly and efficiently was something I was needed while I ranked from 1-14. With the release of Season of Mastery I decided to convert this project using Typescript, SASS & other libraries and allow public use.

#### Overview:

- `Store` - Contains the applications data storeage for centralised state.
- `Utils` - The formulas, in-game data files & utility functions for some components.
- `Components` - TSX/JSX Containers & Page Containers.
- `Components/UI` - Simple JSX/TSX components.

#### Build using this technology:
