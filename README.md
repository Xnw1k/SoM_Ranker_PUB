## Getting Started
> This project was built for the World of Warcraft gaming community (specifically Classic-WoW), the goal was to make a clean & simple packaged UI which allowed players to calculate their weekly outcome(s) via the users given data. These caluclations where previously done via Google Spreadsheets which where very tedious so I felt being able to access this data quickly and efficiently was something I was needed while I ranked from 1-14. With the release of Season of Mastery I decided to convert this project using Typescript, SASS & other libraries and allow public use.

### Build using this technology (:<
- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### Assets & Game Data from: 
- [WoWHead](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/pvp-honor-system-overview-wow-classic)
